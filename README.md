# Competitve-Programming-Problems
These problems are training from geeksforgeeks practice (sudo placement), codeforces, Algo&amp;Ds specialization (coursera), algorithms Design book, programming challenges book of skiena
## Motivation:
* Take notes and keep them when solving problems is very important step in improving your programming skills.
  - increase your knowledge
  - avoid past errors and bad solutions 
  - use previous solutions to solve new problems 
  - avoid thinking from the beginning
