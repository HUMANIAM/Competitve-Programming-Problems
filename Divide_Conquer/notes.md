## Examples

- **Merge sort** : 
you divide the array into smaller sub arrays and sort them then you combine the sorted sub array with other sorted sub array. in average case this will take O(nlog(n))

- **Polynomial Multiplication**
you are given two vectors presents the coefficients of two equations A(x), B(x). size of every one of them is n and you need to find the result of the result vector of multiplying A and B.
